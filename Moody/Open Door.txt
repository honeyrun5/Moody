I've seen mountains
I've seen breaches
Distant seas
Uncharted beaches
I've seen light
From many welcome ports
I've been warmed on
Tropic islands
Lost in city's
Sounds and silence
I've been found
On many golden shores
I've lived the stories
Heartbreaks and glories
The happiness and the strife
The tears and the laughter
Of a life
Lately I dreamed
I had tasted
All life's treasures
But still my heart fills me with pleasures
This life's an open door
